The aim for this project it to be very easy to access, so please have a look through the [issues](https://github.com/Energy-Price-News-API/energy-prices-api/issues) listed to see if any suit your current or desired skills. The maintainers of the project will try to keep it all as up-to-date as possible.

I would like to encourage contributions of any kind to this project:

- Issues:
  - Suggestions on how to do something
  - Problems/bugs found in the code
  - Ideas for features
  - Discussion around best practices so that others can learn from your experience/knowledge
- Pull Requests
  - Should you have a feature you'd like to share already coded, please submit a detailed pull request
  - A preferred PR format is not yet defined, so we ask you just use common sense and include the type of info you'd like to see as a maintainer
- Documentation
  - Spellchecking and typo corrections are **ALWAYS** welcome :joy:, seriously, I hate typos but make them frequently!
  - Further detail. If you feel something needs to be expanded on, please do so and submit your PR.
  - Wiki: If we get to a point that a wiki would be helpful, please open an issue/discussion with your suggestions
  - As the project grows, this `CONTRIBUTING.md` file will need updating, so add to it where you see fit.
- Share what you do
  - In order to encourage others to join in, feel free to share what you have done on your social media/websites
  - If you know someone that has done something similar, please show them this project as their input would be greatly appreciated

### A link to a resource for people who have never contributed to open source before.
Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can check out: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how for *free* by checking [this repo, first-contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/main/README.md).

# Getting started
### A quick walkthrough of how to submit a contribution.

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:
1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Try to follow the code style for the project
    * Note our Code of Conduct.
    * Send a pull request.

> **Note**
> For instructions on getting up and running please give the [README.md](https://github.com/Energy-Price-News-API/energy-prices-api/) a quick read.

>At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:
>
>If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.
### If you have a small or "obvious" fix, you may also...

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up

# How to report a bug or request a feature or documentation
Please use the issue templates [found in the issues tab](https://github.com/Energy-Price-News-API/energy-prices-api/issues) and fill out the various sections. The more detail you can provide, the better!

## Code review process
This project is currently maintained by only two developers that volunteer their free time between work and family. They're both passionate about the project and try to stay as up-to-date as possible but sometimes will not be available immediately. Please do not be discouraged if your question or PR is not addressed within 24-48 hours, we **WILL** answer everything as fast as we possibly can.

Any and all contributions are greatly appreciated and encouraged because the **main** aim of this project is for us all to learn about various aspects of this huge world of web development.

### Finally
Thanks very much for your consideration of this project and for taking the time to read through this document.

Yours

Sam
